### Nikolai

Hei! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Nikolai and I'm starting my third year at Haaga-Helia studying software development (Well, I am studying IT, but I've been mostly focusing on software development)
While I am somewhat decent at Getting Stuff Doneâ„¢ with Python and JavaScript, my programming true love is Haskell, though I've been slacking with it lately. I am also pretty good at Lua and have been learning C++ on the side.

# Programming things I've doneðŸ˜„ 
- A bunch of React and React Native projects
- Helsinki University's MOOC Haskell course
- Helsinki University's MOOC Data Structures & Algorithms course

# What I'm working onðŸŒ±
- Getting this degree done
